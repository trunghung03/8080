# AIT-8080

An 8080 emulator written based on [kpmiller's Emulator 101 guide](http://emulator101.com/). It is still in the initializing phase, hoping to seeing first release soon.

## Why the name AIT-8080?

Based on the name of the ship in Space Invaders (in one of the later games), since this game will be the first one to be tested on this emulator.
