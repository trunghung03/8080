# 8080

An 8080 emulator written based on [kpmiller's Emulator 101 guide](http://emulator101.com/). It is still in the initializing phase, hoping to seeing first release soon.

The display is made with raylib

## Current Status
Display is outputting garbage, but the CPU is running through most opcode in Space Invaders fine.
